## About

This is a intuitive GUI application that can be to create an army roster of the Space Marines faction for the tabletop 
game Warhammer 40,000. It makes the army creating process much easier, as all of the rules and restrictions of Warhammer 
40,000 are automatically taken into account. Any roster incompatibilities will be highlighted and the total points cost
of the roster will be automatically calculated.

This was originally my final year project for my degree, but I wish to further improve it by including all of the factions of 
Warhammer 40,000.

Please note that currently this application runs with rules set out in the 7th edition Space Marine codex book, and is
therefore out of date.
